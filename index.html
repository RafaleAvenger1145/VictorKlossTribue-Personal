        <p>
            Victor Kloss was born in 1980 and lived his first five years in London, before moving to a small town in West Sussex. By day he built websites, by night he wrote (or tried to).<br><br>
            His love for Children's Fantasy stemmed from Enid Blyton, Tolkien, and recently, JK Rowling. His hobbies included football, golf, reading and taking walks with his wife and daughter.
            <br><br>After fighting a losing battle against lymphoma, Victor passed away peacefully in Sussex, England on 5 November 2016 surround by his loved ones. At the time, he was in the middle of writing Book 6, the final instalment in the series Royal Institute of Magic. He is survived by Tara, his wife of 10 years, and his three-year-old daughter.<br><br>
            hank you to everyone who has sent messages of condolences and support. We invite you to continue to be part of this <a href="http://www.royalinstituteofmagic.com/">community</a> of readers and fans. We have many exciting things on the horizon for the Royal Institute of Magic, including the completion of Book 6 in 2017.<br><br>Victor wrote the following text about his life in 2014, and weâ€™ll leave his words as they are for you to read.

        <h2 class="subheadings">WRITING</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Needless to say, I enjoy writing. Hence the book. Iâ€™ve been writing fiction since I left school. Like most people, I like to write what I would like to read. Iâ€™m very picky about pace, ease of reading and I like humour. Most of all I like to enter a world that I would love to be part of.</p>

        <h2 class="subheadings">READING</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            I used to be mad about epic fantasy (I read Game of Thrones many years before it became a phenomenon) but lately I find myself reading childrenâ€™s fiction and mainstream thrillers. Iâ€™m the sort of person who will download thirty samples for the Kindle, and probably only read two or three books. Picky!</p>

        <h2 class="subheadings">OTHER STUFF</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            I live in West Sussex with my wife of eight years and my two-year-old daughter. I enjoy taking walks in the Ashdown Forest and spending time with my family. Iâ€™m also a sports fanatic across just about every sphere.</p>

        <p>A letter from Victor Kloss:

            <br><br>
            Dear Readers and Fans,
            <br><br>
            It has been my privilege to entertain you these past two years. I wanted to share some news that nobody (least of all me) is happy about. I won't harp on, but there are a few things I'd like say, and I'm sorry if they cause you pain.
            <br><br>


            Throughout my life I have had physical issues, which have slowly impacted me over the years. I have a serious liver disease, as well as lung disease, and an entirely inadequate immune system. Although I've managed to live a wonderful life (loving family, wife and daughter) I have finally hit a hurdle that I just canâ€™t jump.
            <br><br>


            I have an aggressive form of Lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system). I've been fighting it for a while, but it has reached a stage where I only have days left. Now, Iâ€™m hoping your first thought isn't about Book 6! But I will get to that and I have a plan.
            <br><br>


            I'm only thirty-five years old, yet I make a good income from writing, which I love. However, I have a wife and 3-year-old daughter (who doesn't know yet), and one of my biggest worries is that my wife will not be able to support herself as a single mother.
            <br><br>


            In desperation, Iâ€™ve turned to Patreon knowing other artists have been funded in such a manner. So many of you have expressed your delight in the Royal Institute of Magic that I thought you would be willing to return the favour by pledging a small amount. Your support will ensure the completion of Book 6, and it will further other projects, such as my audio books currently in production. It will also ensure new readers continue to discover this series.
        </p>
